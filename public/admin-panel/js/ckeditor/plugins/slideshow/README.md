The needed files for "ad-gallery" and "fancybox" are located under the 3rdParty directory, in the plugin package.
They are just copy of the files from respective web sites (ad-gallery and fancybox), just a fews modifs have been made
in the as-gallery css file, for info, and for curious people, the diffs compared to the original are in the patch
file under this ad-gallery directory.
Normally, nothing special has too be done with these files. If you like to change their location, just edit the "slidesho.js"
 and update the variables on top of this file.

Requirements
-------------------------
To correctly work, you need to have access to CKEditor, KCFinder (or any stuff to allow to upkoad images
on the server), ad-gallery javascript / css and fancybox javascript and css.
